# Hrana Over Http SDK
An implementation of Hrana over HTTP from turso. 
Here is the specification from turso, https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/HTTP_V2_SPEC.md

I was looking for an SDK to use turso. There is already one but I did not find one I liked. So created one. This is very early still.

# Whats implemented and tested?
- Can connect to turso with bearer token.
- Tested CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements. They are working

# How is this implemented?
- I wanted to finish it fast so used refit library. It's barely finished... but whatever. Good for an hour of work :)
